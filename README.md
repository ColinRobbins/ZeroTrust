# Market Drivers
An increasing acceptance of the fact that organisations cannot assume their internal networks have not been compromised.
The increased reliance on networks that an organisation no longer owns or controls.

# Background – the story so far
Pre- ZT
De-perimiterization, Jerhico Forum, circa 1994
Early pioneers (depending on your definition)
Google – Beyond Corp (2009), NCSC – CloudClient
ZT as a concept Forrester, John Kindervag (2010)

Today – almost every vendor (!) 
So we need a definition
Some high-level principles
Some shared experiences
Vendor supplied definitions often use vendor influenced lenses.
Non-vendor definitions may need further interpretation. 

# NIST Definition(s) SP 800-207

Zero trust (ZT) provides a collection of concepts and ideas designed to reduce the uncertainty in enforcing accurate, per-request access decisions in information systems and services in the face of a network viewed as compromised. 

Zero trust architecture (ZTA) is an enterprise’s cybersecurity plan that utilizes zero trust concepts and  encompasses component relationships, workflow planning, and access policies. 

Therefore, a zero trust enterprise is the network infrastructure (physical and virtual) and operational policies that are in place for an enterprise as a product of a zero trust architecture plan. 

# NCSC Principles (summary version)

- Single strong source of user identity
- User authentication
- Machine authentication
- Additional context, such as policy compliance and device health
- Authorisation policies to access an application
- Access control policies within an application
