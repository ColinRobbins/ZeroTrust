# The ZT Concept
Zero Trust Networks Architectures assume that networked devices should not be trusted by default, even if they are connected to a managed corporate network. In most modern enterprise environments, corporate networks consist of many interconnected segments, cloud-based services and infrastructure, connections to remote and mobile environments, and increasingly connections to IoT devices. The once traditional approach of trusting devices within a notional corporate perimeter, or devices connected to it via a VPN, makes less sense in such highly diverse and distributed environments. Instead, the Zero Trust Networking approach advocates checking the identity and integrity of devices irrespective of location, and providing access to applications and services based on the confidence of device identity and device health in combination with user authentication.

# Definitions

## NIST Definition(s) SP 800-207

Zero trust (ZT) provides a collection of concepts and ideas designed to reduce the uncertainty in enforcing accurate, per-request access decisions in information systems and services in the face of a network viewed as compromised. 

Zero trust architecture (ZTA) is an enterpriseâ€™s cybersecurity plan that utilizes zero trust concepts and  encompasses component relationships, workflow planning, and access policies. 

Therefore, a zero trust enterprise is the network infrastructure (physical and virtual) and operational policies that are in place for an enterprise as a product of a zero trust architecture plan. 

## NCSC Principles (summary version)

- Single strong source of user identity
- User authentication
- Machine authentication
- Additional context, such as policy compliance and device health
- Authorisation policies to access an application
- Access control policies within an application
